# Fendirain

A Minecraft mod I have huge plans for. Curretly highly WIP, and is not guaranteed to work, and may even break everything.


Currently added:


Mob(s):

Fendinain - Collects Sapings on the ground & plants them. You could help them along and give them some as well (Right click with saplings in hand, It will take as much as it can).


Ore(s):

FendiOre - Currently useless, But I have future plans for it. Feel free to disable it's generation, But it is very rare, So you can just keep it on anyways.


Item(s):

Fendi - Currently useless, But I have future plans for it.
Redstone  Infused Fendi - Currenly useless, I plan on removing it.


Block(s):

Fendi - Currently useless, But i have future plans for it (Including, But not limited to, renaming it).
